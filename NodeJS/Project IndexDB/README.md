Project Description:
The project you developed with IndexedDB is a simple example of managing user data (such as email and password) on the client side using the browser. Instead of storing data on a server, it is stored and managed locally in the user's browser via IndexedDB.

Overview of the Project:
Main Page:

The page includes text input fields for entering email and password, along with Submit and List of users buttons for adding and displaying the user data.
There is also a table used to display the list of stored users.
IndexedDB:

IndexedDB is a non-relational database that allows you to store and retrieve data on the client-side (in the browser).
This project uses IndexedDB to store user information such as email and password.
Creating and Managing the Database:

A database named sample is created or opened using the indexedDB.open method.
If the database needs to be upgraded (e.g., creating tables), the onupgradeneeded function is triggered to create an Object Store named sample.
The data is stored as objects containing email and password, and each record is assigned an auto-generated primary key (id).
Main Operations:

Add Data: By clicking the Submit button, the entered email and password are stored in the IndexedDB.
Display Data: By clicking the List of users button, the stored data is fetched from IndexedDB and displayed in the HTML table.
Delete Data: Clicking the Delete button clears all the records from the database.
Key Features:
Storing users in the browser database using IndexedDB.
Displaying a list of users in the HTML table based on the data stored in the database.
Clearing the entire database using the Delete button when needed.
Benefits:
Using IndexedDB allows users to store and retrieve data locally in the browser without needing an internet connection.
This project is suitable for applications that require client-side data storage.
Use Case:
This project can be part of a user management application within a browser. For example, it could be used in a note-taking app or task management system that requires local data storage.
